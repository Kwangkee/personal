Data Systems for Managing and Debugging Machine Learning Workflows, https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/554603

>This thesis aims to tackle the usability problem of modern machine learning systems. This involves taking a broader view which goes beyond the model training part of the ML workflow and developing a system for managing this workflow.
>This broader workflow includes the data preparation process which comes before model training, as well model management which comes after. We seek to identify various pitfalls and pain points that developers encounter in these ML workflows.
>We then zoom into one particular kind of a usability pain point – labor-efficient data debugging. We pinpoint two categories of data errors (missing data and wrong data), and develop two methods for guiding the attention of the developer by helping them choose the instances of data errors that are the most important. We then empirically evaluate those methods in realistic data repair scenarios and demonstrate that they indeed improve the efficiency of the data debugging process, which in turn translates to greater usability. We finish up with some insights which could be applied to design more usable machine learning systems in the future.
